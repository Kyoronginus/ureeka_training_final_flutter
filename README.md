=== FINAL FLUTTER TRAINING IDEA ===
-APP NAME : TRIPSAGE-YOUR AI TRAVEL COMPANION.

-APP BUILT TO HELP USERS WHO :
    1. Feel overwhelmed when planning a vacation.
    2. Don’t have time to research destinations.
    3. Want a travel recommendation tailored to mood, budget, weather, and personal interests.
    4. Prefer a conversation-like experience instead of navigating complex travel websites.

-APP'S CONCEPT :
    An AI chatbot that acts as a personal travel advisor.
        -Users can ask open-ended questions like:
            1. "I want to travel this weekend, somewhere cool, with mountains or nature views, and under $200. Any ideas?"
    The chatbot will:
        1. Analyze input context (budget, duration, mood, etc.)
        2. Pull real-time data (weather, prices, events, hotel availability)
        3. Recommend the most relevant travel destinations, with explanations and optional itineraries

-FEATURES :
    1. Smart Chat Interface :
        -Conversational design — no complex forms
        -Handles free-form questions like:
            “Should I go to the beach or mountains this weekend?”
            “Is Jogja still rainy this week?”
    2. AI Travel Recommender :

        | User Mood/Goal  | NLP classification based on user chat: healing, adventure, cultural, etc. |
    3. Custom Itinerary Generator
        -Once a destination is chosen, AI builds a 1–7 day travel plan

            -top attractions
            -Activity schedules
            -Suggested food places
        Flexible: can be compact (tight schedule) or light (relaxed pace)
    4. Traveler Profile Memory
        -AI learns your style over time:
            1. Do you like solo travel?
            2. Low budget or premium?
            3. Prefer nature or city?
    5. Quick Travel Q&A Support
        You can ask:
            1. “Do I need to bring a jacket to Bandung this week?”
            2. “Which beaches in Bali are not crowded right now?”
            3. “I only have 2 days in Seoul—what shouldn’t I miss?”
        
-BUSINESS MODEL :
    1. Affiliate Travel Bookings : 
        -Integration with booking platforms (Traveloka, Agoda, Booking.com)

    -Understands mood and context (ex: "healing", "cheap nature getaway", "2-day short trip")
    -Provides holistic answers, like:
        “You could go to Dieng, it’s cool weather this week, not too crowded, costs around $100 total for 3 days, and offers mountain views.”
    -Acts like a virtual travel buddy before and during trips.
